##### ! Warning !
`Before doing anything, remember that this project is in early stages of development. And most of the stuff are very unstable or broken. If you are interested to contribute, please do not hesitate to try it.`

## Download ISO Image

- Access [Actions page](https://github.com/EnderIce2/FennixProject/actions/workflows/makefile.yml) from the GitHub page.
- Select the latest run and under "Artifacts" you will find the ISO file (it's ZIP compressed).
- Unzip it and add it to a virtual machine as CD-ROM.

---

## Download, compile & run

- Clone this repository using

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/EnderIce2/FennixProject
```

Before doing anything, you must install the following packages:

```bash
# Debian Based Systems
sudo apt-get install make gcc-mingw-w64-x86-64 gcc-mingw-w64-i686 mingw-w64 qemu qemu-kvm xorriso genisoimage ovmf nasm doxygen build-essential bison flex libgmp3-dev libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev texinfo mtools
```

And follow this [page](https://wiki.qemu.org/Hosts/Linux#:~:text=for%20both%20variants.-,Building%20QEMU%20for%20Linux,-Most%20Linux%20distributions) to install the required packages for QEMU.
If you want to use the one that comes with your distribution, go on `tools/Makefile` and remove `do_qemu` at line 11 (starts with `all:`) and update `QEMU_PATH` variable inside `Makefile.conf`.

- Go to the local repository and run the following command

```bash
make tools
```

This command will download all the required files to compile the operating system.

After that, you should be able to compile the operating system.

- Currently it was tested **only** on **Ubuntu 20.04** and **Ubuntu 22.04**. I don't guarantee that it will work on other distributions or older versions of Ubuntu.

---

- To run the OS:

```bash
make run
```
<sub><sup>or `make build` to build it without running.</sup></sub>

- To cleanup the code:

```bash
make clean
```
